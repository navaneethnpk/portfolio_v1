On July 11 2022, US President Joe Biden unveiled one of the James Webb Space Telescope's first images of deep space as a preview. Showing us an unprecedented new image of a region of space known as SMACS 0723 – a deep field into the distant Universe.  

JWST is the most powerful telescope launched into space to conduct infrared astronomy. After launching on 25 December 2021, JWST was undergoing testing and alignment until June 2022. JWST is built by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), in partnership with ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).

The image covers a patch of sky roughly the size of a grain of sand held at arm's length by someone standing on Earth.

The image shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago. The SMACS 0723 is in the southern constellation of Volans. It's a good target for this sort of observation because there are massive clusters of galaxies in the foreground.  

Because of the great mass of this cluster, their gravity causes curvature of the space-time around them, with the effect of magnifying light from more distant objects. It's a gravitational effect; the astronomical equivalent of a zoom lens for a telescope.

This deep field, taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), is a composite made from images at different wavelengths, totalling 12.5 hours. We can see thousands of galaxies. Webb, with its 6.5m-wide golden mirror and super-sensitive infrared instruments, has managed to detect in this picture the distorted shape (the red arcs) of galaxies. JWST has produced the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date. 

The full suite of first images is released on 12 July 2022.
